# Lyrical_Genre_Classification
This repo contains the classification of musical genres based on the Lyric using the methods of Deep Learning done with my friend Dorian Desblancs.
n  this  project,  we  explore  the  field  of  musical  genre recognition using lyrics.  We first introduce a 10000 trackdataset that spans 12 genres.   The lyrics present in it arethen  classified  using  a  multitude  of  popular  NLP  algo-rithms  such  as  CNNs,  Bidirectional  LSTMs,  and  Bidirec-tional GRUs superimposed on pre-trained GloVe or fastTextword embedding layers. We also report results obtained us-ing a pre-trained BERT model.   Our best model obtainedan average test set accuracy of 70%. This result is close tothose obtained by more elaborate audio-based classifiers onmuch smaller datasets.  It also surpasses past benchmarkson lyrical genre recognition tasks.
